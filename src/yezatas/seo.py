"""SEO scorecard: deterministic checks per video, a 0-100 score and a "fix next" priority.

Pure code, no I/O and no model calls, so the suggestion agent can cite these facts.

INTERFACE (stable; the web UI codes against it):
- `channel_context(videos)` -> ChannelContext: facts across the catalog (duplicate titles, ...).
- `score_video(video, context)` -> Scorecard.
- `score_catalog(videos, ...)` -> dict video_id -> Scorecard (builds the context once).
- `fix_priority(video, card)` -> float: views x missing points; higher = fix first.
- `CATEGORIES`: display order and labels of the check categories.
- `parse_duration(iso)` -> seconds or None; `CHECKS`: the ordered check functions.
