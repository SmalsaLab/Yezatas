"""The Yezatas web app: the setup screen, the SEO dashboard, the content table, video pages and
the edit, review and push screens, plus the AI suggestions and the agent log.

Pages only read from YouTube through the catalog pull. The one write is `POST /changes/push`,
which sends drafts the creator approved and ticked a confirmation box for. A suggestion only ever
makes a draft. A confirmed thumbnail and a confirmed comment reply are posted from their own
confirmation pages. Background jobs open their own Store, because a SQLite connection must not cross
threads.
